# TODO: Integrate Points, PointMaterial, and OrbitControls into BackgroundAnimation

- [ ] Update DynamicParticles component to use <Points> and <PointMaterial> from @react-three/drei instead of native Three.js elements, maintaining existing animation behavior.
- [ ] Add <OrbitControls /> inside the Canvas to enable interactive controls without altering the background's visual or animation functionality.
- [ ] Verify the changes do not introduce errors and that the background animation remains unchanged.
